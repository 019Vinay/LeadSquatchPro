## Usage Guide

### 1. Tech Stack Finder
- Enter a technology name (e.g., "Shopify", "React", "WordPress")
- Set the number of companies to find
- Click "Find Companies" to discover businesses using that technology

### 2. Email Extractor
- Process existing leads or enter a specific domain
- The system extracts emails and scores them based on role importance
- CEO/Founder emails score highest, generic emails score lowest

### 3. Lead Enrichment
- Enrich existing leads with additional company data
- Adds information like company size, industry, location, and LinkedIn profiles
- Uses multiple public sources for comprehensive data

### 4. Export Leads
- Download your leads in CSV, Excel, or JSON formats
- Filter by email quality, company size, or other criteria
- Includes CRM integration templates for popular platforms

## Email Scoring System

The platform uses an intelligent scoring system:
- **90-100 points**: CEO, Founder, President emails
- **80-89 points**: Director, Manager, VP emails
- **70-79 points**: Sales, Business Development emails
- **50-69 points**: General contact emails
- **20-49 points**: Info, Support emails
- **0-19 points**: No-reply, automated emails

## Technical Features

- **Multi-source data collection**: GitHub, technology showcases, company websites
- **Email validation**: Format checking and MX record verification
- **Data deduplication**: Prevents duplicate leads in your database
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful web scraping with delays
- **Session persistence**: Data persists during your browser session

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure all dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Port already in use**: If port 8501 is busy, Streamlit will automatically use the next available port

3. **Slow performance**: Large-scale lead generation takes time. Start with smaller batches (5-10 leads)

4. **No emails found**: Some websites may block scraping. Try different domains or use the manual domain input

### Performance Tips

- Start with 5-10 companies when testing
- Use the verification feature to check technology detection accuracy
- Process leads in batches for better performance
- Export data regularly to avoid losing progress

## Data Sources

The platform gathers data from:
- Company websites and public pages
- GitHub repositories with live sites
- Technology showcase directories
- LinkedIn company profiles (public data only)
- Public business directories

## Export Formats
